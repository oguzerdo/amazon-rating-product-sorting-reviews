# Sorting Amazon Reviews

![IMAGE](/images/project1.png)

# Business Problem

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after the sale.

The solution to this problem means more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, product prominence for sellers and a smooth shopping experience for buyers.

Another problem is the correct ranking of the comments given to the products. Since the prominence of misleading reviews will directly affect the sales of the product, it will cause both financial loss and customer loss.

In solving these 2 basic problems, e-commerce sites and sellers will increase their sales while customers will complete their purchasing journey smoothly.
