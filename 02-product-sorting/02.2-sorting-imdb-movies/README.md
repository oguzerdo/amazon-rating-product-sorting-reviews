# Business Problem

IMDB movies are intended to be ranked with various ranking approaches.

In this study;

- A ranking based on Vote Count, Vote acerage numbers as well as a ranking based on the average weight of these factors

- IMDB weighted average

- Bayesian Average Rating (BAR Score)

furthermore, at the end of the study, a hybrid solution of all these approaches and a ranking approach is discussed.
