# Rating Products

# Business Problem

People often look at the average user rating of a product before buying it online

Let's take an average. For example 4.764925.

This is a preferable, important indicator. But we may be missing the latest trend in products. Positive or negative trends in the presentation or use of the product may lose their impact.

This project involves a study on how to calculate the most accurate score for a product by making various evaluations on the scores given to a product


For example, if a product received very high ratings in its first three months, it may have the same weight as others and thus miss the recent trend of liking it more or liking it less.
